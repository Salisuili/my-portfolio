  Bootstrap's .container class has default horizontal padding.
  If the "space" you're referring to is this internal padding, it's normal for Bootstrap.
  If it's external space causing a scrollbar, the above 'overflow-x: hidden' should fix it.
  You generally don't want to remove all padding from .container unless you're explicitly handling gutters.
